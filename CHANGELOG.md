## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `owner:plane-pages:build` builds the derived Pages image from the upstream backend image (or `PLANE_BACKEND_IMAGE`) and prints its tag and source digest, without touching any container. Use it for Saltbox-managed hosts where the running API image is local (PTC-45).
- `ce_page` update replaces an existing Page body. It needs an `expected_updated_at` precondition and `force=true`, disconnects open Live editors first and keeps the old body as a page version (capped at 20). It refuses only if the body changed while editors closed, and reports a late Live overwrite with 409. Both server payloads changed; redeploy them (PTC-44).

### Changed

- Legacy deploy names are centralised in `plane_toolchain/legacy.py`, with a test that rejects new references elsewhere. Behaviour is unchanged.

### Fixed

- The Plane bridge and session status resolve git-ignored `config/local.env`, `config/plane.enc.env` and `tools/mcp-remote/node_modules` from the main checkout when a linked worktree lacks them (`config/local.env` merges per key, the worktree overriding). Only linked worktrees fall back.
- Pages revert accepts a derived container built from older source, so an upgrade can run revert, then apply.
- Restoring the original API (revert, reconcile) checks API health only: the upstream image has no Pages route, so the Pages probe made every revert roll back.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-12

### Added

- Plane CE extensions and GitHub Actions integration examples.
- Security policy and pull request template (#10).
- Pinned lint of workflows and shell scripts with actionlint, zizmor and shellcheck (#6).
- Renovate configuration for pinned dependency updates (#11).
- Pre-commit config matching `mise run check` (#15).
- Default-branch ruleset recorded with maintenance commands (#5).
- Tag-triggered release workflow and this changelog (#19).
- Pages deploy health check probes a Pages route (#22).
- Remote deploys survive SSH disconnects; Pages apply reconciles a half-finished run (#24).
- Pages revert finishes an interrupted revert (#25).

### Changed

- Deploy remote programs are built from testable functions (#12).
- Declare `httpx2`, enable ruff `S` rules and use mise Python in CI (#14).
- MCP bridge runs a locked `mcp-remote` tree; Node pinned to 26.13.1 (#20).

### Fixed

- Pages revert recovers from failures and a repeat revert is idempotent (#17).
- MCP compat deploy waits for health, rolls back, and keeps receipts kill-safe (#18).
- Retained rollback containers no longer auto-start (#23).

- Bridge loads checkout connection settings and the encrypted key.
- Default SOPS age key path when the bridge runs outside mise.
- Pages backend returns 404 for missing projects and a slim list payload (#9).
- `PLANE_ENABLED` parser is shared and state files are hardened (#8).
- CE tools canonicalise IDs, guard SDK private calls and use a configurable bind host (#7).

### Security

- Example write workflows allow-list trusted events and fail closed (#13).
- Pages API responses never include internal error text (#16, #21).
